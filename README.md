# Ascii Art

A program that (hopefully) converts images to ascii art

Packages needed are:

<ul>
	<li> PIL
	<li> matplotlib
	<li> scipy
	<li> numpy
	<li> tkinter
	<li> os
	<li> subprocess
	<li> platform
	<li> webbrowser
</ul>

You can run ```$ make``` in most ubuntu (perhaps in other distro's as well) to install all necessary packages. This will ask for the super user password for installing ```tkinter``` and ```pip3```.

To run execute the command ```$ python3 AsciiArt.py```
